Predicting house prices using machine learning models.

It is a Kaggle competition named House price prediction-Advanced regression techinques

Here I have created a simple model to predict the house prices.

House_price.ipynb is the main model Final Projects Kaggle.ipynb is the model used for feature engineering for test dataset

Datasets used:
